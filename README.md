# 🏙️ CoBuild: Enabling Better Community Housing and Infrastructure Planning  
_A smarter way to plan Victoria’s growth – keeping neighbourhoods liveable, inclusive, and connected._

---

## 🚨 The Challenge
Victoria is growing faster than our infrastructure can keep up. Every housing approval brings opportunity, but also risk:  
- 🏫 Overcrowded schools  
- 🚌 Congested roads and transport networks  
- 🏠 Rising rents and housing stress  
- 🏥 Strained community services  

Right now, housing approvals are often made **without a full picture** of how they affect schools, transport, and community wellbeing.  
The result? **Pressure on residents, councils, and governments** that could have been predicted and prevented.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. **See today’s reality** → Housing costs, school crowding, bus frequency, and resident sentiment.  
2. **Forecast tomorrow** → Example: “+300 homes → +50 students → transport at 90% load → rising concern about school access.”  
3. **Act early** → Councils & planners get alerts before crises, backed by data & community input.

## 🌟 Why It Matters
- **Residents:** Understand how neighbourhood changes impact daily life.

## 📍 Case Study Example
> **“500 new homes approved in Brunswick → School capacity hits red, transport at 95%, childcare full in 2 years.”**  
CoBuild flags this before approvals, giving decision-makers time to expand capacity, add bus routes, or rethink plans.
